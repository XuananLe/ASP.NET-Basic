### C# Basic CRUD Learning Repository
I am currently learning ASP.NET core Web API with SQL Server and Entity Framework Core. This repository is a learning project that I am using to practice the basics of C# development, including CRUD operations, data modeling, and database migrations.
### Overview

This repository provides a basic implementation of CRUD operations using C# and a relational database. The project structure and code samples are designed to guide you through the process of working with data, performing CRUD operations, and understanding key concepts in C# development.

### Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

2. Open the project in your preferred development environment (such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider).

3. Set up the database:
- Ensure that you have a local or remote database server (such as SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) available.
- Configure the database connection settings in the project's configuration files (such as `appsettings.json`) to point to your database server.

4. Run the application:
- Build the project to ensure that all dependencies are resolved.
- Run the application to start the CRUD learning environment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Models**: Contains the C# classes that represent the entities in the database (e.g., Student, Course, Enrollment, Instructor, Course Assignment,...).
- **Data**: Contains the DbContext class (e.g., SchoolContext) responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD operations.
- **Controllers**: Contains the API controllers that handle the HTTP requests and execute the corresponding CRUD operations.
- **Views**: Not applicable for this repository since it focuses on building API controllers.
- **Migrations**: Contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core to create and update the database schema based on changes in the models.
